                  <p>Benvenuto Cellini was a 16th century Italian artist best known for his statues &#38; sculpture works in silver &#38; gold. His most famous murder was an act of revenge against his brother's killer, but Cellini later confessed that the murder was unjust as his brother's killer acted in self defense. He went on to claim at least two other victims including a rival goldsmith as well as commit several other crimes before dying in Florence in 1571. <a href="#Cellini">Sources</a></p>

                  <p>Ronnie &#38; Reggie Kray were known for organized crime in London during the 1950's &#38; 60's. Their gang "The Firm" was involved with everything from murder to arson. Their artistic sides blossomed in prison in the form of chilling paintings &#38; chalk drawings that later netted over $26,000 at auction. <a href="#Kray Twins">Sources</a></p>

                  <p>Sid Vicious acheived fame as the bassist &#38; vocalist for the Sex Pistols. His sad tale is a hazy, drug-induced spiral that culminated in the stabbing &#38; subsequential death of his girlfriend, Nancy Spungen. Sid attempted suicide several times &#38; eventually succeeded by heroine overdose just months after Nancy's death. <a href="#Sid Vicious">Sources</a></p>

                  <p>In 1976 after murdering a young woman, Jack Unterweger was sentenced to life in prison where he authored short stories, poems, plays, &#38; an autobiography. He was released after serving the mandated minimum of fifteen years &#38; gaining minor celebrity status from his autobiography. Unterweger used this traction to become a local news reporter &#38; by the end of his spree reported on at least 11 murders that he himself committed before finally being caught. <a href="#Unterweger">Sources</a></p>

                  <p>To wrap up this disturbing list, we end with the most insidious of them all, Adolf Hitler. His brutal genocide of millions &#38; incredible destruction across the European theatre brought the world to its knees. But before his reign of chaos &#38; needless killings, he had a dream of being an artist. His watercolors of Vienna are a haunting look at a beautiful view from a terrible mind. <a href="#Hitler">Sources</a></p>
